# P vs NP Research Log

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Computational exploration of the P vs NP problem
**Repository**: https://github.com/MikeyBeez/millennium-p-vs-np
**Status**: Initial Setup Complete
**Started**: 2025-07-30

## Research Strategy

### Core Philosophy
Rather than attempting a direct mathematical proof (which has eluded the world's best mathematicians for decades), we're building computational tools to:

1. **Explore the boundary** between P and NP complexity classes
2. **Search for patterns** in NP-complete problems  
3. **Build verification tools** for polynomial-time algorithms
4. **Create research infrastructure** for complexity theory exploration

### Target Areas

#### 1. Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)
- Core NP-complete problem
- Well-understood structure
- Excellent solver ecosystem to build upon

#### 2. Graph Problems
- Hamiltonian Path/Cycle
- Graph Coloring
- Maximum Clique

#### 3. Optimization Problems
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Knapsack Problem
- Set Cover

#### 4. Number Theory
- Integer Factorization
- Discrete Logarithm
